### Start
1. Enterpreneurial Management
- Building a startup is an exercise in instituion building; this, it is necessarily involves management.
- This often comes as a surprise to aspiring entreprenuers, because their associations with these two words are so diametrically opposed.
- Entrepreneurs are rightly wary if implementing traditional management practices early on in a startup, afraid that they will invite bureaucracy or stifle creativity.
- Entrepreneurs have been trying to fit the square peg of their unique problems into the round hole of general management for decades.
- As a result, many entreprenuers takes a "just do it" attitude, avoiding all forms of management, process, and discipline.
- Unfortunately, this appraoch leads to chaos more often than it does to success. 
- The tremendous success of general management over the last century has provided unprecedented material abundance, but those management principles are ill suited to handle the chaos and uncertainty that startups must face.
- Entrepreneurship requires a managerial discipline to harness the entreprenurial opportunity we have been given.
- There are more entrepeneurs operating today than at any previous time in history. this has been made possible by dramatic change in the global economy.
- To cite but one example, one often hears commentators lament the loss of manufacturing jobs  in the United States is increasing (15 percent in the last decade) even as jobs continue to be lost (see the charts below).
- In effect, the huge productivity increases made possible by modern management and technology have created more productive capacity than firms know what to do with.
- We are living through an unprecedented worldwide entrepreneurial renaissance, but this oppurtunity is laced with peril. Because we lack a coherent management paradigm for new innovative ventures, we're throwing our excess capacity around with wild abandon.
- Despite this lack of rigor, we are finding some ways to make money, but for every success there are far too many failures: products pulled from shelves mere weeks after being launched, high-profile startups lauded in the press forgotten a few months later.
